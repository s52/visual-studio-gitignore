# visual-studio-gitignore
Visual Studio Gitignore File

- Edited 10 Apr 2018 to add app.config web.config and Passwords.cs
- Edited 10 Apr 2018 to add Connections.cs and Private.cs
- Edited 10 Apr 2018 to remove app.config and web.config
- This repository is in **Dropbox\copyable-code\visual-studio-gitignore** not git-projects

## Recommendations for Storing Private Data

- Put private data in one of the files listed above
- Create a file of the same name appended with _TEMPLATE
- So for example Passwords.cs_TEMPLATE
- Only the template file will be saved to the git repo

## Comments

- We do not currently know which is the best to use of the five files listed above
- Passwords.cs is probably the current favourite
- It may be that app.config and web.config do not need to be present by default so removed
